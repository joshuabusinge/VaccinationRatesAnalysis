# VaccinationRatesAnalysis
Vaccination Rates Analysis for Preventable Childhood Diseases in Nigeria.
The objective of this data science project is currently centered around analyzing and deriving insights from the vaccination rates of children aged 12-23 months against preventable childhood diseases in Nigeria. 
The dataset, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018, is currently accessible through an API. 
The project is actively striving to create client value by delivering data-driven insights and recommendations for enhancing vaccination rates.

# Project Abstract

## Objective
The objective of this project was to conduct an analysis of vaccination rates for preventable childhood diseases in Nigeria. 

## Analysis Focus
The analysis focused on the following aspects:
- Understanding the coverage and variations in vaccination rates across different vaccines.
- Examining vaccination rates among different states in Nigeria.

## Dataset
The dataset included information on vaccination rates for the following vaccine categories:
- Measles
- Penta 1
- Penta 2
- Penta 3
- "Any" vaccine (general vaccination rate)

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and pre-processing were performed to ensure data quality.
2. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights from the dataset.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed important insights:
- Significant variations in vaccination rates among states, indicating potential disparities in healthcare infrastructure and accessibility.
- Differences in vaccination rates by vaccine type, suggesting variations in vaccine availability and prioritization.

## Implications
These findings can be used to inform targeted interventions and improvements in healthcare to enhance vaccination coverage and mitigate the impact of preventable childhood diseases in Nigeria.
